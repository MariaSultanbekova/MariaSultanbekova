# Hello there!

I have been programming for 3 years now, and 2 of them have been studying ML. Yes, I started at school (I skipped classes and hid with a laptop in places hidden from teachers🤓🐱‍💻). In 2021, I became a prize-winner in the Olympiad on artificial intelligence from Sberbank. Now I am studying in absentia at the Faculty of Information Technology of Shukhov University. At the moment I am engaged in computer vision, but there will be projects in other areas, besides, I was really interested in NLP before.
