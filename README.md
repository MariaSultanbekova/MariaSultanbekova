## I am a beginner machine learning engineer.

I have been programming for 3 years, studying machine learning for 2 years and recently started studying the topic of computer vision. In my repositories, we can find projects on classification, segmentation, image detection, as well as NLP-related projects. In the future, there will be many complex and interesting projects using the newest ideas and models of computer vision
